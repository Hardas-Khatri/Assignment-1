For running this following code, I used two libraries one Is default added in jupyter IDE and other one for printing emoji. Emoji by default not added so that I import emoji library by using this command in anaconda prompt: pip install emoji

import emoji 
import sys
print("I am using python >>>>\n"+sys.version+"<<<<This version"+emoji.emojize(":grinning_face_with_big_eyes:"))

#funtion of date and time is imported
import datetime
# date_time is a variable in which time and date stored by using funtion datetime.now()
date_time = datetime.datetime.now()
#This line prints the string message
print("Current Date and Time is: ")
#Actual Output printed by this line, funtion str is basically string function that converts the defined value into string format
print(str(date_time))

Output:
Current Date and Time is:

#formula for computing area of circle by radius is: pi multiply by r square 
#in mathematics value of pi is 3.14 or 22/7 
# variable by in which pi value stored
pi = 3.14; 
# r is another variable that used for user input with data type float
r = float(input ("Please inter the value of Circle  Redius then Hit Enter to get area of circle: "))
#actual result formed by following line
print ("Area Computed: "+str(pi * r**2)+" by your input")
